This project aims to provide a fresh new way to experience the Pokemon Nuzlocke challenge by telling you ahead of time which Pokemon you're able to catch up front. This gives rarer Pokemon encounters a more equal chance of being on your team, and has the benefit of allowing the open world Pokemon games to be Nuzlocke-able at all without a convoluted ruleset (Not that you can't use one if you want I won't judge)!

The rules are simple:

THE TRADITIONAL RULES:
1) All Pokemon must be nicknamed.
2) Any Pokemon that faints is considered dead and must be released or kept in a box to never be used again.

THE NEW RULES:
1) You can only catch one Pokemon per route, which will be generated for you. For example, if your Pokemon Red version generates Pidgey on Route 1, you can only catch the FIRST Pidgey you encounter. Just like a traditional Nuzlocke, if you kill that encounter, you can no longer catch on that route.

OPTIONAL RULES:
1) The list also generates a random Starter choice and has a potential to be a Wildcard which lets you choose whichever you want. You do not have to use this if you want.
2) If you get a duplicate rolled, whether by catching it earlier or evolving it from a Pokemon you already caught, you can either:
    - Catch the first non-duplicate Pokemon you encounter, traditional Nuzlocke style
    - OR
    - Treat the location as a "Wildcard" and pick whichever Pokemon you want
3) If you roll a Pokemon that has a 10% or lower catch rate (which will be stated next to the Pokemon name), then you have the option to treat it as a traditional Nuzlocke catch or as a Wildcard.
4) Water on routes with both land and water are special (for now). You can choose to catch one or the other, or both.
5) You have access to other optional rules like the Wobbuffet Clause or the Shiny Clause.
6) Unique encounters such as static Pokemon (Kecleon in Gen 3 or Sudowoodo in Gen 2) and trades can be gotten and do not count as a "catch" for that route.


HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM:
This program is written entirely in Python. As such you will need Python to run it. You can download Python from the homepage ( https://www.python.org/downloads/ ). This was written in Python 3.11.9 so I'd recommend at least version 3.12. If you run into problems with installation, Google it for now. I am not experienced with this yet but plan on updating my own Python version soon TM.

Once you have Python installed you want to make sure you're running the py file with it and not opening it as a text document. Right click "List Generator - Pokemon Nuzlocke SCR.py" and open with "Python" and it should run.
It'll ask you to input your game which is as simple as typing in "red" (without the quotes).
This program includes the data for:
Red Version, Blue Version, and Emerald Version

More will be added later.
